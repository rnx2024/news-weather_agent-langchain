# ðŸ›° Weather + News Agent (Modularized)

This Streamlit app fetches weather + news for a city and summarizes them using a LangChain ReAct agent powered by OpenAI.

---

## Features
- **Weather**: Uses OpenWeather API for current conditions.
- **News**: Uses SerpAPI (Google News engine) for top 5 headlines.
- **Agent Reasoning**: LangChain + OpenAI agent decides when to call tools (`get_weather`, `get_news`).
- **Summary**: Produces a single-paragraph natural language brief.
- **UI Options**:
  - Toggle between *direct pipeline* and *agent reasoning*.
  - Optional summary toggle.
